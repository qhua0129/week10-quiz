### Setting Up a Local Server using Python

In order to bypass CORS restrictions when loading local files, it's recommended to serve your project using a local server. Python provides a simple way to do this.

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing your project files using the `cd` command.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   
2. **Start the Local Server**

    If you're using **Python 2.x**, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
    ```
   If you're using **Python 3.x**, run:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
3. **Access the Project**

    Open your preferred web browser and go to:
    http://localhost:8000
